<h3># Project Description :page_with_curl:</h3>
<p>## Tech Academy final project - Hackathon. The project is being developed by systems development students. The technological solution presented in this project aims to connect the farmer, businesses, restaurants and producers of agricultural inputs, so that these producers can collect what would be thrown away and transformed into organic compost. Thus avoiding waste and encouraging agricultural producers to adopt sustainable practices.</p>

<h3>Problem presentation:</h3>
<p>The United Nations (ONU) defined the 5 main factors causing food waste: Agricultural production: losses due to mechanical damage and/or spillage during the harvesting operation; Post-harvest handling and storage: losses due to spillage and degradation during handling, storage and transport between farm and distribution. Of all the fruits and vegetables that go to waste in Brazil, around 50% are lost during transport and handling, processing and distribution.<p>

<h3>Justification:</h3>
<p>New technologies appear every day, however, the solutions presented are not always accessible to the target audience. Seeking to serve from the small producer to the large merchant, Sustenta-Tech has developed an easy-to-use tool, which can be accessed by desktop and mobile devices.</P>

<h3>Sustenta-Tech</h3>
<p>The website that aims to connect farmers, businesses, restaurants and producers of agricultural inputs, so that their solid waste (food) has the correct destination and can be transformed into organic compost.</p>

<h3># Project Status</h3>
<p align="center">Website developed. In which it is now possible to register both waste partners/donations and those interested in obtaining this material for transformation into organic compost.</p>


<h3># Technologies used:</h3>
<p> HTML5, CSS, JavaScrip</p>

<h3>Responsive features</h3>
<p>Desktop view / Mobile</p>
